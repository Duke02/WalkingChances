# Walking Chances

This is a repository that I made to simulate a practice problem I had in my Probability and Statistics textbook. 
I was incredibly interested in it, and so wanted to make a program that would do the problem and plot the results.

## The Original Problem
This was in the Bivariance section of my textbook. The textbook can be found 
[here](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Hogg-Probability-and-Statistical-Inference-9th-Edition/9780321923271.html).

```
Problem 4.1-7 (page 133)
A particle starts at (0, 0) and moves in one unit independent
steps with equal probabilities of 1/4 in each of the four
directions: north, south, east, and west. Let S equal
the east-west position and T the north-south position
after n steps.
```

## Environment
This project used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as a way to manage dependencies. 
The full package list can be found in `conda-packages.txt`.
